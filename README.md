INFOWAR


Uncover weird conspiracies and fight interdimensional reptilian vampires.

This is meant to be a side scrolling 2.5D RPG/beat em up based on the unique mythology of various conspiracy theorists. It is inspired by a few videos that nobody seems to have capitalised on yet, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeTWpEneLvU and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIs3JcQpTBQ for example.

In order to build this you'll need the irrlicht engine 1.8.3 and bullet3 physics library 2.86.1. The paths are set up to look for these a level above this projects root where the .git directory is. You might need to adjust the additional include directories - I should make these relative.

There's probably a lot of legality around the people involved that would be a roadblock for making games based on them. There's also the touchy political climate we have nowadays where even a joke like this can be seen as offensive or somehow tacitly supportive of some things, but this game specifically is just a fun unique universe that lends itself to interesting design.
